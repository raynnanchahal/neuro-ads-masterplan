# Section 6 – EXECUTION PHASES, MILESTONES & LAUNCH PATH

## 🧭 CORE PRINCIPLE: Launch Fast, Scale Smart

> The goal isn’t to build a “perfect website.”  
> It’s to **launch a high-leverage conversion asset** — and compound its power over time.

We move in **4 Phases**:
1. **Phase 1** – Launch Foundation (MVP with conversion power)
2. **Phase 2** – Authority Layer (Case Studies, Neuro Lab, Email)
3. **Phase 3** – Offer Expansion (Courses, Coaching, Education)
4. **Phase 4** – Platformization (Dashboard, Community, Automation)

## ⚙️ PHASE 1 — LAUNCH FOUNDATION (Weeks 1–4)

**Objective**: Ship a fully-operational site that installs the Aha Moment and converts qualified leads.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Core website copy (built from this plan)
- Webflow site build (1-pager w/ modular sections)
- Calendly or SavvyCal booking embed
- Meta + TikTok pixel integration
- Scroll-triggered animation or brain visual (optional, but powerful)
- Responsive mobile version
- Basic analytics setup (GA4 + Hotjar)

### 🎯 Milestone:
- Website goes live
- Bookings begin from cold traffic, referrals, or warm outreach

---

## 🔍 PHASE 2 — AUTHORITY + REENGAGEMENT LAYER (Weeks 5–8)

**Objective**: Add trust, proof, and re-engagement channels

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Add Case Study module (3–5 micro stories or dashboards)
- Launch Neuro Lab v1 (content section with insights, breakdowns)
- Launch email capture + nurture sequence:
  - Insight > Proof > Call CTA loop
  - Subject lines engineered to open curiosity loops
- Install retargeting campaigns:
  - One for visitors who hit “Aha” section
  - One for call-booking bounce
  - One for non-clickers with belief reversal copy

### 🎯 Milestone:
- Increase conversions from retargeting
- Build pre-sold lead base that didn’t convert on visit #1

---

## 📚 PHASE 3 — OFFER EXPANSION (Month 3–4)

**Objective**: Unlock your mid-market (non-DFY) funnel and create an info product flywheel

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Build Course/Coaching funnel page (either Skool, Kajabi, Teachable, Webflow + Memberstack)
- Design course messaging using Neuro positioning:
  > “Train your brain to build ads that scale”
- Add second CTA nav: “Learn With Us” → course page
- Cross-sell to DFY leads who aren’t ready for full engagement
- Add upsell stack to lead magnets (e.g. “Deep Buyer Psychology Playbook”)

### 🎯 Milestone:
- Generate revenue from education
- Build your student community + scale productized value

---

## 🧠 PHASE 4 — PLATFORMIZATION (Month 6–12+)

**Objective**: Turn Neuro Ads from a service into an ecosystem

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Client dashboard portal (analytics, asset review, reporting)
- Gated Neuro Lab content for paying clients/members
- Neuro Academy backend (videos, assessments, frameworks)
- Optional: Slack/Discord/Circle-based community
- Implement behavioral-based CRM (e.g. tagging based on page visits, quiz logic, etc.)

**Optional Add-On:**  
- Diagnostic quiz funnel:  
  > “What’s Blocking Your Brand’s Neural Growth?”  
  → Creates awareness score, adds segmentation, builds lead quality

### 🎯 Milestone:
- Neuro Ads becomes not just a company — but a category  
- Clients, students, and prospects orbit the brand via multiple trust channels

## 🛠️ OPTIONAL EXECUTION SUPPORT SYSTEM

If delegating this to a team or freelancer, make sure they follow this:

### 🔒 Non-Negotiables:
- Design is conversion-first, not decorative
- All copy comes from a *single tone system* (as defined earlier)
- The site must feel like a **diagnostic conversation**, not a product pitch

### 📂 Project Management Tips:
- Use Notion or Trello to break each section into deliverables
- Use Loom to explain copy intent to designers
- Use Miro to map the funnel flow visually if onboarding new hires
